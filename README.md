![](./images/wiki-logo.jpg)

This last homework consists of to create the wikipedia graph pages given by the professors. We are focus to clean up before doing the homework our datasets. After, we write many different algorithms in order to solve the professors requests. 

Few algorithms that we used in this homework are:

- BFS first implementation
- BFS second implementation
- DFS
- Nearest Neighbor
- PageRank

and many other..

We tried to maximize the efficiency of our algorithms with different implementation using dict, defaultdict, native creation of the graph and other efficient techniques, this functions are placed in functions.py attached in this repository. 

The repository consists of the following files, other than the readme.md file and the images folder:

1. __`functions.py`__: 
    *functions.py is the all functions defined by us for all questions in this homework.

2. __`ADM_HW5.ipynb`__:
    *ADM_HW5.ipynb is the main procedure of all questions.
   
n.b: We haven't used any other types of datasets in this homework

*Homework made by Jeremy, Haotian and Danial*
