# Homework 5 - Explore Wikipedia's hyperlinks network

![alt text](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia#/media/File:Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg)

This last homework consists of to create the wikipedia graph pages given by the professors. Then that, we are focussing to clean up the datasets and then we write many different algorithms in order to solve the professors requests as:

- BFS first implementation
- BFS second implementation
- DFS
- Nearest Neighbor
- PageRank

and so on...

We are trying to maximize the efficiency of our algorithms with different implementation using dict, defaultdict, the native creation of the graph and other efficient techniques, where you can see into the functions.py. 

The repository consists of the following files, other than this readme.md file:

1. __`functions.py`__: 
    *functions.py is the all functions defined by us for all questions in this homework.

2. __`ADM_HW5.ipynb`__:
    *ADM_HW5.ipynb is the main procedure of all questions.
